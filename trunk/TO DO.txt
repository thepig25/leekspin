Hey guys,
Just a few points to make:
If you are going to be working on this, please be on gtalk
so we know who is working on it and update your code first always
and commit often.
MAKE GOOD COMMENTS!!!

Jobs to be done:
look up java inhertiance, extends , interfaces
someone should understand how this works, especially for oop

As I was saying before, I think we should really make a plan of the classes
that we're going to be implementing beforehand and state specifically what
each should do, rather than just hacking out code.

We know that that's bad practice and we've been told this year and last year 
that planning it out and keeping it as simple as possible is the best policy.
If there's one thing that Joe taught us, it's to state the obvious and keep
things simple. Methods should do one thing only! So anything a player can do
in real life ie.fold, raise, check, should have one method dedicated to it.

For example, we need a CommunityCards class at the moment that interacts with
the PokerHand class in a way that every player will have their own PokerHand
constructor when they're created, but there will be only one CommunityCards
constructor for all players. And both classes must use the same deck of 
cards as they are dealt. I think it's best to plan this out now rather than 
writing a whole load of code and then having to change it later on and 
having problems. It's also easier in terms of the team as we all know
exactly what has to be done, rather than looking at someone else's code and
trying to figure out how that will fit into the bigger picture.

Sorry for the rant! Just thought I'd point all this out now before there's a 
whole lot more coding done. Let me know what you think.
